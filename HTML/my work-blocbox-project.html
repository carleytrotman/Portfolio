			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<p>Hanker has a friendly and welcoming vibe. I harnessed my southern roots and used stylistic embellishments to pair southern hospitality with modern web aesthetics. Some motifs I drew on were heavy solid lines encasing lighter ones, subtle color banding, and lines with curled ends.</p>
			<p>Hanker’s name takes a cue from the colloquial term hankerin’, which means to have a strong desire for.</p>

			<h2>Wireframes and User Flows</h2>
			<p>I chose user flows that always started or ended up on a page with recommended food truck content. Ideally, hungry users should not spend energy searching for food. The app is designed with a discovery page that the user lands on every time they open the app, so they are always shown the freshest recommendations. </p>

			<p>The other pages: "Featured", "Specials" and "Nearby", are shown as lower links in a tab-like format for fast navigation. When tapping the hamburger button on the top left of each main screen, the action slides the account menu across the screen from the left.</p>
			<p>When a user taps on a food truck profile, the top navigation menu is replaced with page specific actions: Back and Checkout. The food truck menu is accessible by scrolling down past the photo and profile. This way the user is never more than a few taps away from the main discovery page or their account settings.</p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
			<p>I used Lookback to record users testing the first iteration of my Hanker prototype. My users were smartphone owners, ate at food trucks, and were within the 20-40 age range. I found that most users had no difficulty navigating onboarding, landing pages, search, and the map. Several of them tripped over search filtering and ordering workflows, which meant I needed to rethink them. </p>
			<p class="alltext">For search filtering, I clarified how to complete filtering. To do this, I added Cancel and Apply top buttons in the filters modal. For ordering, I made it more apparent when the user updated their cart and how to checkout. I replaced the Add button with plus/minus buttons to indicate number of orders and emphasized the order total with the shopping cart icon.</p>

			<h2>Final Prototype</h2>
			<p>I developed many versions of Hanker’s high fidelity mocks. Key principles that influenced the final interface include:</p>
			<p><span>Photographs and illustrations draw the user in. </span>When possible, display less text. Since this is a food truck discovery app, people’s emotional and hunger responses will be triggered by images of food. I kept copy lighthearted and pair with illustrations during onboarding to underscore the app's personality. </p>
			<p><span>Keep the checkout page standardized with other online merchants. </span>Don’t break the mold during critical flows involving payment. Use text size and placement to enhance the readability of a checkout page, so that users can quickly scan the page for salient information.</p>
			<p><span>Usability above all. </span>I base every design decision on my original problem statement: Will this help a user find a tasty food truck quickly? The main way to achieve usability is to create a set of UI patterns and differentiate each by content not style. Create consistency so that users know what to expect. Keep it simple. </p>
