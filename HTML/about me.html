 <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3> "...The broader one's understanding of the human experience the better design we will have." Steve Jobs</h3>
        <p>
          "With an eagerness to experience different cultures and explore the world across the realms of itâ€™s diversity, my journey into design stemmed from a drive to broaden my human  experience.</p>
        <p>
          Since emigrating from the beautiful island of Barbados over 10 years ago, I have embraced the opportunities and challenges throughout 
          my journey to become  a proud alum of Howard University and Georgetown University, while working across diverse industries building skills as a Marketing and Communications Specialist. <a href="#" class="map"><img src="images/barbados.png" /></a></p>
        <p>
          Wanting to increase my technical capabilities and understand best practices for designing user experiences, I enrolled in the UX/UI Design track at Bloc, Inc.</p>
        <p>
          As I reach the end of my UX/UI bootcamp experience, I am on a mission to find my tribe in tech. Along the way I want to help  organizations thrive by desiging experiences that enable meaningful human connections and collaboration.</p>
