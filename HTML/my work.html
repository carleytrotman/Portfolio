      <p> In wanting to live a more creative life, I have been very intentional in pursuing the things that spark my curiousity. </p> 
      <p> As I matriculated through graduate school, understanding and designing their customers' experiences was the primary challenge I observed brands were facing in their businesses. </p> 
      <p> Not wanting to lose the momentum and drive that comes with working through a Masters degree, I enrolled in the UX/UI Design Fbootcamp offered through Bloc, Inc a few short months afer completing grad school. With no prior design or coding experience, I embarked on one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences I have had to date. </p>
      <p> The projects below are a compilation of the design challenges completed during my Bloc experience. Take a look and let me know what you think. </p>
