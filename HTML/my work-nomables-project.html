			<h2>Soooo, where do we want to go for lunch?</h2>
				<p>At some point, we have all been in a situation where this question has been asked. From the size of the team, to the vegan-gluten-free-lactose-intolerant dietary restrictions of co-workers, coming to a concensus of where to go for lunch can be a conundrum that no one saw coming.</p>

				<p>While there are solutions available that allow users to view a variety of menus, order food and provide an option for delivery or pick up from traditional food businesses, Nomables is a solution on the iOS platform, that allows users to find food trucks near their location and select items for purchase.</p>

			<h2>Strategy</h2>
			<p>Selecting and ordering food items from a food truck is not a capability that has been developed or is widely available. Using this as a proposed business case, Nomables is a design concept to solve this business problem. My design approach was structured on conducting <strong> Research </strong> to provide benchmark data on what is currently available in the market. Once the data is analysed, the insights gleaned would be used to develop a <strong> Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </strong> for Nomables. This MVP would used in <strong>User Testing </strong> scenarios to evaluate the user experience of the Nomables solution. The market research findings and the observations from the user testing scenarios will be combined to develop a <strong> Final Prototype </strong> for Nomables.</p>

			<p> Each phase in designing this solution is made of several components. These components are explained in detail in the sections below.</p>

	<section class="research">
		<div class="container">
			<p> During the Research phase of designing this solution, there are three components that were developed to provide informed analyses of products offering food selection and ordering capabilities. These components include a competitive analysis, user personas and user flows.</p> 

			<ul>
				<li><strong>Analysing the current competitive landscape <!-- <insert link for competitive analysis --> for food ordering services</strong></li>
					
					<p> Nomables is a new product is very saturated market, facing competition from products with both mobile and web application capabilities. The competitors in the space included market leaders - Grubhub Seamless, Eat 24 (acquired by Yelp) and recent entrants - UberEats, Postmates and Caviar.</p>
					<!--<a href="" class="btn">View Competitive Analysis!</a> -->

				<li><strong> Indentifying the users who are impacted the most by the current problem - to understand their motivations and frustrations and,</strong></li>
				
				<p> While the quest for a good lunch spot can be overwhelming, there were three target audiences that I identified as being the most affected during the search. These audiences included:</p>
					<ul> Corporate Noms - corporate teams that are too small to utilize traditional catering menus </ul>
					<ul> Selective Noms - "picky eaters" who lead a healthy lifestyle either by choice or circumstance</ul>
					<ul> WeeklyDaily Noms - individuals who work in urban areas with a heavy corporate presence </ul>
					<!--<a href="" class="btn">View User Personas!</a> -->

				<li><strong>Assessing the capabilities of the proposed solution</strong></li>
					
					<p> With an understanding of <strong>what</strong> was currently offered in the market and <strong>who</strong> would be impacted the most and likely to benefit from using Nomables, I outlined the process flows for the Nomables application. 
					<!--<a href="" class="btn">View User Flows!</a> -->
			</ul>

			<p> The research conducted for Nomables highlighted the gaps or missed opportunities with the current products offering food selection and ordering. One primary 'pain point' in the current market was the observation that while users could choose a menu based on location or type of cuisine, coming to a concenus by narrowing down the available menus was still difficult. To address this problem directly, Nomables was designed to help reduce the indecisiveness that occurs from having too many viable options.

			<p> The research phase provided the data to create a framework necessary to build the <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP)</strong> for Nomables. The components for the MVP included:
			<ul class="MVPcomponents">
			<li> Wireframes - use the Balsamiq tool to generate renderings of the Nomables designs</li> <!--<a href="" class="btn">View Wireframes!</a> -->
			<li> Prototypes - build high-fidelity prototypes in Invisionapp </li> <!--<a href="" class="btn">View High-Fidelity Prototypes!</a> -->
			<li> Usertesting - design User Interfaces for specific processes and submitting each mockup for user testing on the Peek platform</li> 
			</ul>

			<h2>Branding</h2>

			<p>Food has the ability to bring out the best and the worst in all of us. Nomables was chosen as the name for this design solution as a direct correlation to the word 'Noms' - an expression for food being delicious and satisfying.</p>
